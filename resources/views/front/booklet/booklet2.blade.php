            DISTRIBUTED WAREHOUSE COORDINATOR<br>
            FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
        </h3>
        <h3>Who is HUBGEO?</h3>
        <p>Hubgeo.com is owned by {LEGAL_NAME}.</p>
        <h3>Where is HUBGEO physically located?</h3>
        <p>Our headquarter offices are located at {ADDRESS-2}.</p>
        <h3>What does a typical work day consist of for a Distributed Warehouse Coordinator?</h3>
        <p>
            The work day begins at 9am your local time. The first task is to check your assignments to see how many
            deliveries are scheduled to arrive that day and what carriers are delivering them.<br>
            You will have access to tracking numbers which are a helpful resource when trying to route your day and plan
            ahead.<br>
            You are required to check the CRM system every hour for delivery updates and changes to delivery
            schedules.<br>
            You will need to be available to personally accept deliveries when they arrive as this is one of the most
            important responsibilities you have as a coordinator.<br>
            Another main task will be to make certain customers receive their items as quickly as possible and without
            being
            damaged. You will expect each delivery for damage and report any findings immediately to your curator.<br>
            Photographs need to be taken and uploaded into the system for review. In addition, the package will need to
            be
            prepared for delivery to the customer based on their instructions. The package must include the invoice and
            a
            brochure which you will need to insert prior to forwarding to the customer.<br>
            The packages you process do not weigh more than 50 lbs and will be no larger than 30x30x30.<br>
            At all times, the employee must be mindful of processing time. Delays negatively impact our customer
            experience
            and satisfaction ratings. Every effort must be taken to make sure processing times do not exceed 48 hours.
        </p>
        <h3>Approximately how many assignments can I expect to receive each week? </h3>
        <p>
            During the probationary period you can expect to receive anywhere from 5-30 assignments each week. Once you
            have been moved to full-time status the total assignments will number around 50 per week.
        </p>
        <h3>Will I need to relocate for this job?</h3>
        <p>
            This position does not require you to relocate and can be worked out of your current location. After working
            for a year in the position of Distributed Warehouse Coordinator, you may be eligible for a position at our
            head
            office in {OFFICE CITY} as a supervising manager.
        </p>
        <h3>Will I need to travel for this job?</h3>
        <p>
            The only travelling required would be local trips to carrier offices (USPS, FEDEX, UPS, etc) for package
            pickup if required or to a local
            store to retrieve an item for a customer. All travelling is local to your area and your travel related
            expenses are reimbursed by the
            company provided you submit receipts for all expenditures.
