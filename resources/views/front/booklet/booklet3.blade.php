        <h3>Is traveling required as part of this position?</h3>
        <p>
            There is some travel required though it is restricted to your local area. A majority of assignments will be
            brought directly to your home for processing. On occasion, you may be required to pick an item up at the
            carrier’s office if they will not deliver for some reason.<br>
            You may need to drop items off to be shipped out at the carrier’s office (FedEx, DHL, UPS, USPS). You may
            also have the ability to schedule a pickup of an order at your location in case the item is too heavy.<br>
            Keep track of your mileage and any receipts related to business travel expenses so you can be reimbursed by
            the company.
        </p>
        <h3>Are there any part-time positions available in the company?</h3>
        <p>
            All positions offered have full-time hours. However, this position allows for quite a bit of flexibility and
            many employees find that the hours are very manageable.
        </p>
        <h3>Will I have out-of-pocket expenses related to this job?</h3>
        <p>
            There are some expenses associated with the position. They are typically printer supplies, paper and packing
            materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will not be expected to pay for any shipping costs and we will provide you with pre-paid shipping
            labels. You must save all receipts for covered expenses and submit them in order to receive reimbursement
            from the company.
        </p>
        <h3>How will I be paid?</h3>
        <p>
            Probationary employees receive their pay once the 30 day probationary period is completed. They will be paid
            by check which is mailed to the address we have on file. Permanent employees can still have a paper check
            mailed to them or they can have their checks direct deposited.
        </p>
        <h3>What type of benefits come with the position?</h3>
        <p>
            We provide full-time employees with paid sick and vacation time. Employees receive 24 paid vacation days and
            14 paid sick days each year. We offer medical and dental coverage with vision benefits. (Plans will vary
            based on where you reside.) Employees are eligible for health benefit coverage beginning their 2nd month of
            employment.<br>
            The company offers full-time employees the opportunity to participate in our 401k plan when they become
            eligible. They become eligible 90 days after their start date.
        </p>
        <h3>Since I am working remotely, how does the training for the position occur?</h3>
        <p>
            Once you have been officially hired, you will be contacted by your curator. They will provide you with all
            online account logins and the information necessary to get started. During the month of your probation, they
            will be in constant contact with your to provide support, coaching and feedback on your performance.<br>
            The probationary period serves as your training period and you are paid for that time. During this initial
            30 days, you will learn what is expected of you, how to route and plan your day and upcoming week. You will
            also be given assignments to complete within a specified timeframe. Your performance will be constantly
            evaluated and the supervisor will use this performance to evaluate you for a full-time permanent position.
